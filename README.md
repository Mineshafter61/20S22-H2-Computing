# 20S22 H2 Computing
Private set of Computing notes for the class of 20S22

# How to use this set of notes
======
1. Most lesson materials will be parked under the "\_Lesson\_" folder. Files ending with .md (like this one) are notes documents written in Markdown, the easiest language ever. Files ending with .py are Python files for you to run.
   * Some files with other extensions may also be included for reference sake.
2. To ask a question, make a pull request in the "\_AskMeAnything\_" folder.
3. You may want to clone this repository onto your own computer for reference. To do that, type in `git clone https://github.com/Mineshafter61/20S22-H2-Computing.git` into Terminal or Command Prompt.
4. If you find something amiss in this set of notes, you may clone this repository and open it (using your own computer) with an IDE with Git integration (I recommend Atom). After cloning it, edit the notes directly and commit your changes with a pull request. You may also submit questions this way.
